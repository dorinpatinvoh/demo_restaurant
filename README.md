## Customization Guide

### 1. Images
The website uses placeholders. To make it your own, please add the following images to this folder:
- **Hero Background**: Save your main banner image as `hero_background.jpg`.
- **Menu/Gallery Images**: Replace the placeholder icons in the HTML with `<img>` tags pointing to your food photos.

### 2. Colors and Fonts
You can easily change the color scheme by editing the `:root` variables at the top of `style.css`.
- `--primary-color`: Main brand color (currently Orange).
- `--primary-dark`: Darker shade for hover effects.

### 3. Contact Information
Update the phone numbers, WhatsApp links, and address in `index.html` to match your actual details.
